# Live Reload Server Change Log

### Version 1.5.2

<small>in progress</small>

* **Add support for Virtual Path Hosting**  
You can now host a site with an optional virtual path so that you can use relative base paths that simulate virtual directories on a server. Useful for example if you use `https://mySite.com/docs/` folder for a documentation and you want to duplicate that locally. You can with `--VirtualPath /docs/` now.

* **Update to .NET 9.0**  
Updated the server to use the .NET 9.0 Runtime.


### Version 1.3
<small>November 20th, 2023</small>

* **Update to .NET 8.0 Runtime**  
Update to the latest .NET Runtime LTS release upon RTM release. This .NET release significantly improves startup times and smaller improvements in overall processing performance. 


* **Fix: FolderNotFoundFallbackPath Handling**  
Fix `FolderNotFoundFallbackPath` which wasn't working properly on `404` errors when no Razor pages are in use. Moved the handler into it's own endpoint processing logic so it always gets applied when set now.

* **Update Markdown Helper 3.7.0**  
Bring in latest Markdown helpers from `Westwind.AspNetCore.Markdown` including latest updates to Markdig.


### Version 1.2
<small>November 12th, 2022</small>

* **Update to .NET 7.0 Runtime**  
Update to the latest .NET Runtime after RTM release. Overall small performance improvements over 6.0.


### Version 1.1 
<small>November 11th, 2021</small>

* **Add Support for .NET 6.0**  
v1.1 and later now runs on .NET Core 6.0 rather than 5.0 previously. The dotnet tool should automatically use 1.0.x for .NET 5.0 SDKs and .NET 6.0 for 1.1+. The self-contained project and Chocolatey packages now run .NET 6 and the hosted version depends on .NET 6.0 now. .NET 6.0 improves overall performance and memory usage.

* **Add `BrowserUrl` Configuration Switch**  
You can now optionally specify an explicit startup URL when launching LiveReloadServer. The URL specified in `BrowserUrl` can either be absolute (`https://localhost:5200/test.html` or a relative site path (ie. `/test.html` or `/subfolder/test.thml`). If not specified the root URL site URL is used.

* **Fix -OpenEditor Option for Mac**  
Fix -OpenEditor on Mac for opening VS Code by default in the WebRoot folder if specified. Find a x-plat way to open both on Windows and Mac (and likely also on Linux).

* **Better Handling of LiveReload when Pages are manually Refreshed**  
Added better support for disconnecting WebSocket when a page is navigated away from or refreshed. In those scenarios sometimes the WebSocket would still fire after the page has already unloaded resulting in multiple immediate requests on a reloaded page. This should remove some of the request clutter that can 'pile' up, especially when many windows are open at the same time with the same monitored site.

### Version 1.0
<small>March 8, 2021</small>
* **Environment Variable Path Fix ups**  
The WebRoot path can now include Environment variables as well as root path `~` markers to resolve to a fully qualified launch path.

* **Improved Server Hosting Functionality**  
Provide default `web.config` for IIS hosting and updated documentation to allow you to host a shared instance of this server on a Web site. Great for hosting simple 'mostly' static sites that also need a few dynamic features, without having to install and deploy a full ASP.NET Core application. You can install one 'runtime' and use it for many sites.

* **Add `-openEditor` and `--editorLaunchCommand` Config Options**  
The new `-openEditor` command allows opening an editor when a site is opened. This is useful if you just start working on a site and you can both launch the site and the editor at the same time. By default VS Code is launched via `code "%1"` which can be overridden with a custom editor launch command.

* **Improved Retry Handling in Browser if Server is Stopped**  
Retry attempts are minimized if the server is shut down which will reduce initial hits if the server is restarted after a break which should improve startup speed.

* **Externalized Script**  
Remove inline script from rendered HTML content pages and use `<script>` tag to pull in the JavaScript code to reload the page from script.

### Version 0.2.16

* **Add Support for DeveloperErrorPage**  
Since this server is meant primarily for development scenarios, we've added support for the `--DetailedErrors` which when set uses the default ASP.NET Developer error page which provides lots of error detail. Note: You have to provide an `/error.cshtml` page with specific code in the file for this to work ([see docs](https://github.com/RickStrahl/LiveReloadServer##developer-error-page)).

* **Break out LiveReloadServer into a separate GitHub Project**  
Removed the LiveReloadServer project from the Westwind.AspNetCore.LiveReload GitHub project and moved into its own separate GitHub repository.

* **Add --Host Configuration Value**  
You can now specify the host IP Address or domain to bind the server to. Previously the server was bound to localhost which didn't allow for external network access. Using `--Host` as a parameter or configuration value you can now specify `0.0.0.0` for example to bind to all IP addresses and allow external access. The default is still `localhost` but you can now explicitly add external access via `--Host 0.0.0.0` or using a specific IP Address to bind to.

### Version 0.2.4

* **Add --Host Configuration Value**  
You can now specify the host IP Address or domain to bind the server to. Previously the server was bound to localhost which didn't allow for external network access. Using `--Host` as a parameter or configuration value you can now specify `0.0.0.0` for example to bind to all IP addresses and allow external access. The default is still `localhost` but you can now explicitly add external access via `--Host 0.0.0.0` or using a specific IP Address to bind to.

### Version 0.2.3

* **Add Blazor Viewing Support**  
Added support for reading custom extensions like the required `.dll` extension for .NET assemblies in Blazor applications. Also added Refresh Fallback support for client side navigation URLs by allowing to redirect to the `/index.html` page on the client for server side refreshes.

### Version 0.2.2

* **Add Markdown File Support**  
Added support for optionally serving Markdown files as HTML from the local site. Markdown files are loaded as `.md`,`.markdown`, `.mkdown` or as extensionless URLs from the Web site and can participate in Live Reload functionality.

* **Add Console Application Icon** 
Added Console Application icon so application is easier to identify in the Task list and when running on the Desktop. 

* **Update the Sample Application**  
Updated the .NET Core 3.1 Sample application to properly display reference links. Add Markdown Example.

* **Fix: Server Timeout not respected**   
The server timeout was not respected previously and has been fixed to properly wait for the configured period before refreshing the browser instance.

* **Fix: Command Line Parsing for Logical Switches**  
Fix issue with logical switches like `-UseSSL` which were not properly working when configuration was present in the configuration file. Settings of the command line now properly override configuration setting in the config file.
